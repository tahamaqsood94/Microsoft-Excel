# Microsoft-Excel
Mastering Excel is essential for success as a data analyst.
Excited to share my latest project - a bike sales dashboard created using Microsoft Excel!

With this dashboard, I was able to create a clear and visually appealing representation of bike sales data for a local bike shop.

One of the most useful features is the pivot table, which allows the user to quickly summarize and compare sales data across different dimensions.
